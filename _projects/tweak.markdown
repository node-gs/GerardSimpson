tweak is a small CSS library that I have been developing in my spare time.

It revolves around helper classes and responsive layout styling.

I have added functionality to text-align based upon viewport size, I often found that left-aligned elements looked uneven on mobile devices and needed to be centered.

I have added helper classes to speak up 'tweaking' already functional or live html templates 

It's built in scss and compiles to css using npm and node-sass :)

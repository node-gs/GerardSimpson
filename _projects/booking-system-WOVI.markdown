This is a project that I completed for Dealer Solutions.

The brief we recieved was to create a new booking system to replace an outdated and inefficient pre-existing solution.

We used the [Dealer Solutions Web API](https://api.dealersolutions.com.au/)  and worked with the back end team to optimise the API for our requirements.

The booking system was bundled into a Wordpress plugin and injected into their site.

We used Angular 1.5 to build both the client facing and administration facing sections of the project.

Unfortunately due to the sensitive nature of the administration section, I would only feel comfortable showcasing it in person.

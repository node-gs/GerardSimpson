This is the second part to this [post]({{page.previous.url  | prepend: site.baseurl}}).

I had figured out how to represent a playing card in a memory efficient and maintainable way. 

The challenge was then to figure out how to iterate over, loop through and mutate these cards.

I needed to be able to do things like: shuffle all of the cards, deal cards to players, transfer cards from a player to the board and eventually off the board.

I thought to myself "right, I'm going to build this entire thing using vanilla JS, to increase performance and to hone my skills as a javascript developer." and off I went, furiously coding away into the night.

While I was developing this algorithim in my spare time, one of the developers at my work introduced me to [lodash](https://lodash.com/). My ideas on continuing to develop using vanilla JS changed very rapidly. Not only did I discover that lodash was a whole lot easier to read and maintain, but was also [faster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD9utLH3QOk) than vanilla JS and has better cross browser support... huh.

Naturally after finding out that a library could beat native JS in terms of performance, I looked around for other JS utility libraries.

I decided to [stick with lodash](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13789618/differences-between-lodash-and-underscore)

To be continued...
